Project Name: Discount Calculator
Description:
This project provides a simple yet powerful tool for calculating the final price of an item after applying a discount. The tool checks whether the discount is 20% or higher and applies the discount accordingly. If the discount is less than 20%, the original price is returned.

Installation:
No installation is required to run this script. It's a standalone Python script that you can run directly using a Python interpreter.

Usage:
Command Line Execution:

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing discount_calculator.py.
Run the script with python discount_calculator.py or python3 discount_calculator.py depending on your system setup.
Interactive Usage:

Upon execution, the script will prompt you to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage.
Enter the values as requested, and the final price will be displayed.
Functions:
calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
This function calculates the final price after applying the discount.
If the discount is 20% or higher, it computes the discount amount and subtracts it from the original price.
If the discount is less than 20%, it simply returns the original price.
Example Output:
If you enter an original price of $100 and a discount of 30%, the output will be: "The final price after discount is: $70.00".
If you enter an original price of $100 and a discount of 15%, the output will be: "The original price is: $100.00 (No discount applied as it's less than 20%)".
